# Bevy Ball Game

This is the result of me following bevy tutorial from this YT playlist:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVnntJRoP85JHGX7rGDu6LaF3fmDDbqyd

Original code by the instructor:
https://github.com/frederickjjoubert/bevy-ball-game

## Note
- I did this in a different bevy version than the one in the video. I also
coded a couple of things differently.

- The code in the `master` branch follows the contents by the instructor (with
some changes :) ). Each commit in the master branch tells which episode the
code is from.

- The code in the `exploration` branch contains some of the explorations I did
after I went through the full tutorial on YouTube.
