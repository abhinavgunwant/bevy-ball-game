# Bevy Ball Game

This is me following bevy tutorial from this YT playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVnntJRoP85JHGX7rGDu6LaF3fmDDbqyd

Code by the instructor: https://github.com/frederickjjoubert/bevy-ball-game

**Note:** I am trying to do this in a different bevy version than the one in the video and in the repository.
